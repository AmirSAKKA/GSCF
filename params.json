{"tagline":"Generic Study Capture Framework","google":"UA-32770572-1","body":"### Welcome to Generic Study Capture Framework\r\nGSCF is the central module in the Phenotype Database software suite. It is a web application, written in Grails, that hosts study design information for the the studies that are stored in Phenotype Database. Also, it exposes a user interface to create and modify those study designs, to import and export data, and to query and visualize study data.\r\n\r\n## Set up a GSCF development environment\r\nTo set up your own development environment, make sure that you have a recent Java Development Kit (JDK, => 1.6) installed. Also, it depends on Grails 1.3.9, which you can download from http://grails.org and just unzip in a target directory. Make sure that JAVA_HOME and GRAILS_HOME environment variables are set to the respective locations, and that their /bin directories are in your path. Finally, it is recommended to declare a decent amount of PermGenSpace (> 150 MB) for your JVM, because both Grails and GSCF heavily use metaprogramming, and you might run out of it with the standard JVM settings.\r\n\r\nFor UNIX, those commands could for example be:\r\n```\r\n$ export JAVA_HOME=\"/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home\"\r\n$ export GRAILS_HOME=\"/app/grails-1.3.9\"\r\n$ export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$GRAILS_HOME/bin\r\n$ export JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xms256m -Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=200m -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=70 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=10 -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC\"\r\n```\r\nThe shown JAVA_HOME location is the default JDK location in Mac OSX 10.6. For Windows, you can add these options by replacing 'export' with 'set' via commandline, or using the Control Panel or Computer Settings, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base (e.g. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310519).\r\n\r\nIf you have git installed, you can checkout the source from GitHub, otherwise download the zip file or tarball at the top of this page and unzip it.\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/PhenotypeFoundation/GSCF.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, you can run the application using Grails:\r\n```\r\n$ cd GSCF\r\n$ grails run-app\r\n```\r\nThis command should pull in all dependencies and start the project. When it is started, you can browse to http://localhost:8080/gscf to use the application. If you want to use an IDE to edit the code, you could try IntelliJ IDEA, SpringSource Tool Suite, or Netbeans.\r\n\r\n## Set up a full GSCF production environment\r\n\r\nSee INSTALLATION.md in the project root.","name":"GSCF","note":"Don't delete this file!
