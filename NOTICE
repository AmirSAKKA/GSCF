About GSCF

GSCF is a web application aimed at the storage and querying of metadata about biological studies. It also can connect to modules that contain any kind of 'omics' data and implements the CleanDataLayer interface (dbnp.data.CleanDataLayer, see also dbnp.rest.CommunicationManager).

GSCF is developed within the DbNP project (Nutritional Phenotype Database) which is initated by the European Nutrigenomics Organisation. This software is currently developed further in a joint effort of the European Nutrigenomics Organisation (www.nugo.org), the Netherlands Metabolomics Centre (www.metabolomicscentre.nl) and the Netherlands Bioinformatics Centre (www.nbic.nl).
